{"premise": "\nThe US government recently announced new regulations designed to change the way transplant organs are made available to sick patients. Under the new guidelines, donor organs will be made available to the sickest people first, wherever they live in the country. Currently, transplant organs are rationed through a regional system of distribution. The private group that runs the current system, United Network for Organ Sharing, or UNOS, objects to the new regulations. UNOS says the regulations put the federal government in charge of deciding who gets transplants and that many hospital transplant centers would be forced to close. Health and Human Services Secretary Do- Donna Shalala says patients who need an organ transplant should not have to take a chance that an organ will become available in their local area, nor should patients have to travel to transplant centers far from their homes to improve their chances of getting an organ.
